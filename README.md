App is a browser game that allows user to "time travel" and make choices for a person in a certain time period. User can start multiple game sessions not affecting each other similar to ChatGPT chats.

When creating a new session user will go through the following steps:
1 user selects year and location
2 LLM generates a (if possible yearly) timeline of historical events that would affect someone born at this time and place and creates possible origins options for character (lower / middle / higher class)
3 user chooses origin dependant on location and time period from the options generated by LLM
4 LLM starts to generate life story of the character of that origin based on events timeline for this location and period in increments of 5 years ending on a "cliffhanger event" that highlights a consequential event for the character (e.g. choosing apprenticeship or a spouse, moving to a different town, etc.). LLM also creates a detailed historically accurate image to illustrate that event. Those events should take into consideration past, current or future events in the timeline (e.g. a choice for a noble to move to St Petersburg at 1916 might lead to them being killed during revolution). User choice is limited to 4 concise options generated by LLM.
5 user chooses one option to proceed and the game reacts to this choice and LLM reacts to it proceeding to step 4 but taking it into the context that results in step 5 unless user dies as a result of their choice (e.g. during a war or famine) or by reaching an age that would be realistically time of death for someone of this background.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
