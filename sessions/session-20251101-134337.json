The capital city, Paris, was bustling with activity and tension as revolutionary ideas spread among the populace. The streets were filled with the sounds of carts on cobblestones, hawkers selling their goods, and the whispers of political dissent. The influence of the Enlightenment was palpable, with salons and coffeehouses serving as hotbeds for intellectual debate.",

The Estates-General was convened in May 1789 for the first time since 1614, marking the beginning of a political upheaval that would lead to the French Revolution.
