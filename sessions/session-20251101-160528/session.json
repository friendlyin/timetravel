His father, a respected high-ranking officer in the Almohad army, was stationed here, leading campaigns against the encroaching Christian forces. The infant's earliest cries mingled with the clamor of soldiers and the distant echoes of battle. These formative years were spent in Fez, a vibrant city teeming with Islamic scholarship and bustling markets, yet forever shadowed by the looming threat of conflict. Raised with a regimen that mirrored the discipline of an army, he was taught the arts of leadership and warfare by the age of seven. His days were filled with lessons in strategy and physical training, shaping his athletic form and sharpening his features, even as his mind absorbed the wisdom of the Quran and the teachings of esteemed philosophers.",
