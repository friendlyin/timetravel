      "narrative": "Born on a chilly November night in 1409, the cries of a newborn echoed through the backroom of the bustling blacksmith's shop in the heart of Château-Thierry. The boy, named Étienne, was the youngest of three siblings, raised by his widowed father, Jean, a skilled blacksmith known for his robust work on horseshoes and farm tools. Étienne's early years were spent amidst the rhythmic clanging of metal and the roar of the forge, as he learned to distinguish different tools and materials by both sight and touch. By the age of six, he worked alongside his father and older brother, showing a natural aptitude for shaping metals, a talent that would become his lifeline.\n\nThe town of Château-Thierry was a microcosm of the larger feudal world, where artisans like Jean occupied a modest but respected position. Étienne's formative years were marked by the tension of the ongoing Hundred Years' War, which cast a shadow over everyday life. Often, tales of distant battles and shifting allegiances would reach the town, causing a stir among its inhabitants. Despite this, the local economy saw periods of prosperity, driven by the fertile lands and the Marne River's trade. Étienne, by the age of ten, was deeply involved in the local trade network, helping his father negotiate deals and learning the art of commerce.\n\nBy the age of twelve, Étienne faced a pivotal moment. His father, weakened by years of hard labor and the burden of family responsibilities, fell ill, leaving Étienne with the choice to continue his apprenticeship under a neighboring master blacksmith or to take on his father's full responsibilities prematurely. This decision weighed heavily on him, as it would define not only his future but also the survival of his family in these uncertain times.",
